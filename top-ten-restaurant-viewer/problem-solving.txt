The Problem

We are looking for you to find restaurant data and return this in an interface of your
choice.

Using the API provided you will need to send a postcode to return a set of data, you’ll
need to filter this data to focus just on the restaurant data.

You will notice that a lot of data is returned in the ‘restaurant object’ (and in the whole
response!), we’re only interested in the following pieces of data being returned:

● Name
● Cuisines
● Rating - as a number
● Address

The Brief

We would like you to display these four data points in any way of your choosing, this
could be: a web interface, console application, or anything you like.

Regardless of interface we’d like you to limit your shown data to the first 10 restaurants
returned, we’re more interested in how you display each one rather than a huge list of
data.

Please upload your completed solution to Github (bonus points if we can see git
history!).

Please note there is no time limit to this, however we do require completion of the
following assessment criteria.

Assignment Criteria

Ensure you complete the below:

● All four restaurant data points are displayed in your interface (name, cuisines,
rating-as a number and address)
● All interface types will be assessed the same, please focus on displaying the
data
● Add how to build, compile and run your solution into the README
● Include any assumptions or things that were not clear to you in the README
● Include any improvements you’d make to your solution in the README
● Send your GitHub link, with interface including all assessment criteria outlined
above, to john.doe@justeattakeaway.com by/on the morning of your assessment day.

API
The API endpoint you need to access is:
https://uk.api.just-eat.io/discovery/uk/restaurants/enriched/bypostcode/{postcode}

Replace {postcode} with a postcode of your choice eg EC4M 7RF to return restaurant
data in that postcode.
